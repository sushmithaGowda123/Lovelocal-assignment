Algorithm:

To finding the shortest palindrome by adding characters at the start of the given string.

1. Check if the input string s is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Reverse the input string s and store it in rev_s.
3. Iterate over the length of the string s plus one.
4. In each iteration, check if the string s starts with the substring of rev_s from index i to the end.
5. If it does, return the substring of rev_s from the start to index i concatenated with the original string s. This forms the shortest palindrome.
