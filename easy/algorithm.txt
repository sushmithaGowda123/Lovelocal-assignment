Algorithm:

1. Define function named length_of_last_word takes a string s as input.
2. Split the string s into list of words using the split() method.
3. Assign the resulting list of words to the variable words.
4. Return the length of the last word in the words list using the len() function and indexing [-1] to access the last element.
5. the user to enter a string s using the input() function and assign it to the variable s.
6. Print the result of the function call using the print() function.

This algorithm calculates the length of the last word in a given string by splitting the string into words and returning the length of the last word.
