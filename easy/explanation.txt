Explanation:

1. The split() method is used on the input string s to split it into a list of words. split() splits the string at whitespace characters and returns a list of the individual words.
2. The length of the last word in the words list is calculated using the len() function and the index -1. In Python, negative indices count from the end of the list, so -1 refers to the last element in the list.
3. The length of the last word returns the result.


For example, if the user enters the string "Hello world", the function will split it into the list ['Hello', 'world'] and return the length of the last word, which is 5.
